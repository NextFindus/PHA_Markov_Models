# PHA_Markov_Models

Miscellaneous Scripts from my Bachelor's thesis. Part of a project to utilize profile-hidden Markov models was to find known PHA-related genes in genomes and metagenomes of
halophilic archaea. 

hmmsearch_metafile.py: Automated hmmsearch with HMMer in annotated metagenomes.

hmmsearch_bakta.py: Automated hmmsearch with HMMer in genomes annotated with bakta.

genbank.py: Extracting the gene entries between two locus tags from a .gbk file.

kernel_mod_os.py: Visualising the distribution of HMM scores and the genera through a kernel density plot.

localize_mod.py: Creating a tabular summary of HMM hits, their location, and distance to each other in the genome based on HMMer output.

repeat_finder.py: Find common repeats in the upstream region of genes.

## Usage:
Can be found in the head of the individual files.
